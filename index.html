			<p>This website is about web design created by Jade Reynoso as a student project for ARTD 245: Web Design at North Central College in Naperville, IL, in 2023. All the text comes from the following articles located on the Dribbble website. All the images were created by me using Photoshop. The website has been created using HTML and CSS in Dreamweaver. </p>

		<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
		</div>
		
			<p> My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-reynoso-5a206226b" target="_blank">Jade Reynoso</a> (hah-deh) and I am a first-generation Mexican American college sophomore pursuing a degree in Interactive Media Studies with a minor in journalism and Spanish. I bring a unique perspective shaped by my multicultural upbringing and my experience navigating higher education as a first-generation student. This gives me strong resilience, empathy and an ability to connect with diverse groups. My experience working part-time jobs since high school has also instilled in me an excellent work ethic and has taught me how to manage my time effectively while balancing a busy workload.</p>
		
			<p>I am working part-time as a barista at Starbucks while being involved on campus as a DJ and newscaster at <a href="https://www.wonc.org/" target="_blank">WONC</a>, North Central College's radio station. I am also a <a href="https://ncclinked.com/author/jreynoso/" target="_blank">writer</a> for NCC's newspaper, the <a href="https://ncclinked.com/" target="_blank">Chronicle.</a> These opportunities have allowed me to pursue my passions for media, writing and connecting with people from all backgrounds. My bilingual skills in English and Spanish enable me to communicate effectively with diverse groups.</p>
	
			<p>I am seeking internships and entry-level roles in media, journalism, content creation and communication where I can apply my skills and continue learning. I'm a quick learner who brings positivity, dedication and a unique perspective to any team.</p>
